              Welcome to my blog about tech, life and pop culture.

              This site was built with Node.js + Express.js. The site's font is called Raleway and you can get it via <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> (which is really pretty excellent). The name of the blog comes from the lyrics of "Ya Hey" by Vampire Weekend.
