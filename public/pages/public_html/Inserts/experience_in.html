	    <h3>Junior Ruby on Rails Developer</h3>
            <h4>GenArts (June, 2013 - present)</h4>
            <p>My work at <a href="http://www.genarts.com">GenArts</a>
                has been the improvement of the company's Rails-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
                platform. The CRM is used primarily by GenArts' sales
                and support teams to keep records of everything from
                orders to licences to customer accounts.</p>

            <h3>Computer Systems I Teaching Assistant</h3>
            <h4>Amherst College (September - December, 2012)</h4>
            <p>In this introductory course on computer hardware, my responsibilities included
                helping professor Scott Kaplan set up weekly lab assignments, answering
                students' questions in-class, and providing study sessions out of class.</p>

            <h3>Software Development Intern</h3>
            <h4>Ellucian, Inc. (May - August, 2012)</h4>
            <p>As part of Ellucian's summer internship program, I worked full-time 
                as part of a team of other interns on a variety of projects. My work there focused on front-end 
                mobile development and proof of concept projects as well as back-end development and unit 
                testing for a commercial mobile app.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities also included several presentations
            to supervisors and other developers detailing findings and
            progress. The proof of concept was in areas with which the
            development team had little experience; as a result our
            presentations on the systems we built were as much explanatory as they were summary.
