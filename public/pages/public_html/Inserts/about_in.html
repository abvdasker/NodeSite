            <p>
                I'm currently a senior at Amherst College majoring in English and Computer Science, but originally I'm 
				from Boulder, CO. Some of my favorite authors are F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Mark Z. Danielewski. 
				I like programming in Java and use Emacs, NetBeans or Eclipse for coding. Lesser interests include movies, 
				videogames, snowboarding and ruthlessly settling of the isle of Catan.
            </p>
            <p>
                I generally do website design and front-end development, but I also have plenty of experience building mobile apps 
				and to a lesser extent web services.
            </p>

				People frequently ask why I chose to major in such different fields. After I'm done telling them that the difference
				between a pizza and a degree in English is that a pizza can feed a family of five, I tell them that
				I honestly believe literature and coding are connected in more ways than are immediately obvious. People view programming
				as something inherently mathematical and much more grounded in math than writing. I believe in reality it's somewhere inbetween.
